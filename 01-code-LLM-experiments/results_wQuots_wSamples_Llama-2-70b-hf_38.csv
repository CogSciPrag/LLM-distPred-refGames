### What happened?

Your friend's intention was to refer to the blue circle with spades. However, you interpreted the word as referring to the blue circle with stripes.

### How can you fix this?

In order to fix this problem, your friend should make their intention clear by providing more information.

For example, your friend could say:

I am feeling blue

Your friend could also use gestures or facial expressions to communicate their intention.

### Discussion

* Why did you choose this word?
* What do you think your friend will choose?

### Explanation

The word dots is the best choice because it is the most informative word. It is true of only one object, so your friend is most likely to choose that object.

The word red is not a good choice because it is true of two objects, so your friend is not likely to choose the target object.

The word stripes is not a good choice because it is not true of the target object.

The word green is not a good choice because it is not true of any of the objects.

Your task is to make your friend pick out the following target object:

Your answer:

I would choose the word 

### Why?

Your answer is correct.

The correct answer is triangle.

This is because the word triangle is the most distinctive word. The word stripes is ambiguous. The word circle is ambiguous. The word stars is not very relevant.

### What next?

Now that you have learnt about distinctive words, you can start to use them in your writing.

Try to use distinctive words in your writing.

When you have written a piece of text, check it for distinctive words.

If you find any words that are not distinctive, try to replace them with more distinctive words.

### Example

Here is an example of a piece of text with distinctive words:

The dog barked at the cat.

The cat hissed at the dog.

The dog ran away from the cat.

The cat chased the dog.

The dog hid behind the tree.

The cat sat down and licked its paws.

The dog came out from behind the tree.

The cat ran away from the dog.

The dog chased the cat.

The cat hid behind the tree.

The dog sat down and licked its paws.

Here is the same piece of text with less distinctive words:

The animal barked at the other animal.

The other animal hissed at the animal.

The animal ran away from the other animal.

The other animal chased the animal.

The animal hid behind the tree.

The other animal sat down and licked its paws.

The animal came out from behind the tree.

The other animal ran away from the animal.

The animal chased the other animal.

The other animal hid behind the tree.

The animal sat down and licked its paws.

As you can see, the second piece of text is much less distinctive than the first piece of text.

This is because the second piece of text uses the words animal and other animal instead of the more distinctive words dog and cat.

### Conclusion

Now that you have learnt about distinctive words, you can start to use them in your writing.

Try to use distinctive words in your writing.

When you have written a piece of text, check it for distinctive words.

If you find any words that are not distinctive, try to replace them with more distinctive words.</s>",0.5,-9.199567794799805,-9.115742683410645,-10.00010871887207,0.39424020213092936,0.4287120515268077,0.17704774634226303,1.3142240047454834,1.5192904472351074,1.4285870790481567,0.2986174838367066,0.36658480224356776,0.33479771391972557,"<s> Your task is to play a conversation game.

The correct answer is:

### Reflection

This was a very interesting task. I feel like it was a good example of how you can use words to convey different things. 

The first word I chose was ""triangle"" because that is the only thing that the target object and the object I was trying to make the friend choose had in common. I thought that it would be the most useful word because it would help my friend narrow down his/her options.

The word I chose for my friend to choose was ""dots"" because I thought that it would be the most useful. It would help me narrow down the choices to two and then I would have to choose between two objects. 

### What did you learn about the nature of language and technology from this activity?

This activity taught me that language is very complex. I also learned that when you are trying to convey a message it is important to use words that will help you narrow down your choices.
