# LLM-distPred-refGames
Can we derive measures from LLMs from which to predict the full distribution of human choices in reference games?

## Repository structure

* `01-code-LLM-experiments`: Python scripts for eliciting testing scores from LLMs.
* `02-data`: direcotry with different results. See README's within the directory and its subdorectories for more details.
